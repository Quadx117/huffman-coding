# Huffman coding
This project is meant to hold different implementaions of a Huffman based encoder/decoder in different programming languages.

## Java implementaion
This is the implementaion that I did as part of the course IFT-2810 that I followed at University of Montreal in fall 2014. It only contains the encoder.
